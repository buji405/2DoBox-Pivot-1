### 2DoBox-Pivot

Welcome to 2DoBox! Here you can list a title and body of tasks that you need to accomplish. You can use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the importance of your tasks and you can also use the filter bar to search through your tasks and find them with ease. Once done with your task you should click the checkmark button, which will mark your task as complete. If you'd like to filter through your tasks based on importance or completion you can use the corresponding buttons to do so. 

The guidelines of this project were to refactor another student's ideabox project and turn it into 2DoBox. We found it challenging to work with someone else's code base and figuring out how to best refactor the code to make it more readable and performant. We were also asked to add on new features such as the filtering by importance and completed tasks. We did find it challenging to incorporate some of these new features into a codebase we were unfamiliar with but as we refactored we found it much easier to implement. A few new things we got stronger in in this project were creating functions that gave you a value that you could then pass into another function and use. We also implemented writing single responsibility functions, which made it easier to maintain as we added new things on.
