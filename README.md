### 2DoBox-Pivot

Welcome to 2DoBox! Here you can list a title and body of tasks that you need to accomplish. You can use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the importance of your tasks and you can also use the filter bar to search through your tasks and find them with ease. Once done with your task you should click the checkmark button, which will mark your task as complete. If you'd like to filter through your tasks based on importance or completion you can use the corresponding buttons to do so.
